# RFD Tool

**Very much a WIP tool.** Created for specific need I found with my engineering team. Your results may vary

If you want to find out more about RFD's see Oxide's post [here](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion)

This post is great for outlining the process. But they use an all-in-one CIO tool to handle their RFD's.  If you want to be able to display the RFDs like they do you are on your own.

This tool looks to fill this gap.
